# Hate Speech Detection System

## Overview

This project aims to detect and filter out hate speech from text data, thereby promoting a more positive online environment. The system leverages **machine learning** techniques, particularly **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, to classify text as either hateful or non-hateful. The project uses data from social media platforms, where the text data consists of user comments, posts, or tweets.

By implementing this solution, the goal is to contribute to the safety and health of online communities by eliminating harmful language and promoting better interactions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hate-speech-detection.git
   cd hate-speech-detection
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages using **pip**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** and the necessary libraries installed. This project depends on the following key libraries:

   - **TensorFlow** / **Keras** (for model training)
   - **scikit-learn** (for machine learning utilities)
   - **pandas** (for data manipulation)
   - **numpy** (for numerical calculations)
   - **matplotlib** (for data visualization)
   - **NLTK** / **spacy** (for text preprocessing)

4. If you encounter any issues with missing dependencies, you can install them manually by running:

   ```bash
   pip install <library_name>
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7+**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For building the deep learning model.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: The core model architecture used for text classification.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning utilities such as data splitting and evaluation metrics.
- **pandas / numpy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **matplotlib / seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting.
- **NLTK / spaCy**: For natural language processing (text preprocessing).

## Dataset

The dataset used for training this model consists of **social media posts**, including tweets and user comments. The dataset contains a mixture of both **hateful** and **non-hateful** texts, labeled accordingly.

The dataset includes the following categories:

- **Hateful Speech**: Text that includes abusive, offensive, or discriminatory language.
- **Non-Hateful Speech**: Text that is neutral, respectful, and does not contain offensive language.

The dataset has been preprocessed to remove stop words, perform tokenization, and convert text into numerical representations like **word embeddings** for input to the model.

**Data Preprocessing Steps:**

- Text cleaning (removal of URLs, mentions, special characters, etc.)
- Tokenization
- Stop-word removal
- Lemmatization
- Word embeddings using **GloVe** or **Word2Vec**

## Model Architecture

The core architecture of this project is based on a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**, which is suitable for processing sequential data such as text.

### Architecture Details:

1. **Embedding Layer**: This layer converts words into dense vectors of fixed size, enabling the model to capture semantic meaning.
2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: An RNN variant used to capture long-range dependencies in text, which is crucial for understanding context in natural language.
3. **Dense Layers**: The fully connected layers responsible for the final classification.
4. **Output Layer**: A **sigmoid** activation function to output a probability value between 0 and 1 (0 for non-hateful, 1 for hateful).

### Model Training:

- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Metric**: Accuracy

## How to Run

1. Preprocess the dataset:

   Before running the model, preprocess the dataset by running the `data_preprocessing.py` script. This script will clean, tokenize, and vectorize the text data.

   ```bash
   python data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. Train the model:

   You can train the model by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. Test the model:

   After training, use the `predict.py` script to test the model with new input data:

   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

   Enter text to check whether it is classified as hateful or non-hateful.

## Usage

Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify any input text. The prediction process takes the text input, preprocesses it, and feeds it into the trained model, which then outputs whether the input text is hateful or not.

### Example:

```python
import predict

input_text = "This is an amazing day!"
prediction = predict.predict_hate_speech(input_text)
print(f"Prediction: {'Hateful' if prediction == 1 else 'Non-Hateful'}")
```
